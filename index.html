        <p>Once upon a time there was a <span id="adj1"></span> toad named Herbit. Herbit lived in a <span class="noun1"></span>. One day, a big <span class = "noun2"></span> came to his home and started <span id="gerrund1"></span> on his door.
        </p>
        <p>Come out here right now! yelled the <span class= "noun2"></span>. You hopped on my <span class= "noun3"></span> last night and totally broke it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Herbit was very <span id="adj2"></span> and didn't know what to do. He wanted to <span id="verb1"></span> but didn't want to make the <span class = "noun2"></span> any angrier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Herbit came outside and asked <br>
            What if you took my <span class= "noun3"></span>? Would that make you feel better?
            <br>
            The <span class="noun2"></span> said NO. I WANT YOUR <span  class="noun1"></span><br>
            Herbit said OK and gave it to him.
